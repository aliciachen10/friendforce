  ## Description 
  
  Keeping up with friends can be difficult even in the digital age. This is where FriendForce comes in! 
  
  FriendForce is a CRM for personal relationships that allows users to add friends, organize groups based on special interests, and manage events all in one app. In the same way that SalesForce has “accounts, contacts and opportunities” with helpful data fields to manage each, FriendForce has “groups, friends, and events”.

  ## Installation
  
  FriendForce is deployed [here](#). Click on the link to sign up!
  
  ## Usage 
  
  When a new user accesses the website, they will be prompted to login or create an account. 
  
  Once they are logged in, they can see their Dashboard, where they can input information that only their friends can see, including their phone number and address for in-person events. From there, the user can add friends (future functionality will allow the user to send out invitation emails for friends not already signed up with a FriendForce account) and create groups. Love to go hiking with friends on the weekends? Create a group. Have a class project to plan out? Create a group! 
  
  Finally, the user has the option to create and view events related to their groups, making scheduling a breeze!
