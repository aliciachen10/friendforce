# friendforce

## what is friendforce?
Group Six is developing Friend-Force! The world’s first (we think) CRM for friend groups. The application will help friends share information, collaborate, and organize events. 
In the same way that SalesForce has “accounts, contacts and opportunities” with helpful data fields to manage each; Friend-Force will have “groups, friends, and events”. 


## group members
jared kohrt, jennifer liebelt, andrew bumgarner, alicia chen
